# WalkingToTheProject

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-4a3zmh)

This work it's a point of a begining.
Here, I will do probes to take it one personal project.

I'm using diferents dependencies:

- React-dom 17.0.2
- React-router-dom 6.2.2
- React-hook-form 7.27.1

Surely, it will be changing to future.

## Short remarks

I've created one hook and I've used React's Provider, In this form, I make a context.

In this context, it uses it to register me and it's selected a different route
