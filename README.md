[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-4a3zmh)

## This work

This work it's a point of a begining.
Here, I will do probes to take it one personal project.

I'm using diferents dependencies:

- React-dom 17.0.2
- React-router-dom 6.2.2
- React-hook-form 7.27.1
- React-scroll 1.8.6

The outline of this text as follows:

- About this project
- Short remarks
- The commits

## About this project

The first time that I began this project, this one was on StackBlitz. But along of the time, I've had several problems in that platform, so I've decided to start form home.

## Short remarks

I've created one hook and I've used React's Provider, In this form, I make a context.

In this context, it uses it to register me and it's selected a different route

## The commits

I'm trying to write it of the as follows:

```
[action] [file's name] - [ on ] - [short description about  what have done it] - [file's path]
```
I have several acctions:

- Modified
- Add
- Without changes
- New Component

With the file README is something different, because only it will changes on the future or that is it I think now , jejeje
